Im least satisfied with use of Kivy app, I do not have enough understanding to perfectly accomplish kivy work, I am missing some parts. also building in kivy file, structuring the layout was unsatisfied part in this project.
...

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
in development process, testing worked great, loading and saving of files worked great.
...

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I will first arrange steps on completing project, find out best way to complete without time wasting like going back to previous process to fix code. arranging process steps would clearly help on time management and clear coding.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I used subject material on learn jcu, going over lecture slides and lecture videos. I looked over at my works on kivy, and Class, getting idea on completing tasks.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
first challenge, understanding insturction, because there were several instructions on each file, my first challenge was understanding each instruction and planning out which tasks to completet first and as follow. next challenge was moviecollection.py when tested, it had errors so I had to go back and check error line, and fix to pass the testing.
Overcomming 2 challenges were not that difficult, I simply had to read error message, code that made error, understand why the error was generated and fix it.
...

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Class object was challenging to understand and imply on my python file at first, but using Class made code easier, I do not had to rewrite same code in different file, only thing needed is import Class and I was able to use the existing method.
